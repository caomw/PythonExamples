# PythonExamples
This repository contains my first experiences with the Python language. I am a newbie about this language, thus these examples are very basic, and at the introductory level.

The majority of the examples are largely inspired by the Kindle book (in Italian):

"Guida alla Programmazione con Python - Corso completo per Imparare a Programmare in poco tempo" by Giuseppe Ciaburro
