# PythonExamples
This repository contains my first experiences with the Python language. I am a newbie about this language, thus these examples are very basic, and at the introductory level.

The majority of the examples are largely inspired by the Kindle book (in Italian):

"Guida alla Programmazione con Python - Corso completo per Imparare a Programmare in poco tempo" by Giuseppe Ciaburro
Publisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2015

All Python scripts in this repository are tested with the Python 3 under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS) and the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan.
