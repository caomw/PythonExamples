# PythonExamples
This repository contains my first experiences with the <A href="http://www.python.org"><i>Python programming language</i></A>. I am a newbie about this language, thus these examples are very basic, and at the introductory level.

The majority of the examples are largely inspired by these Kindle books:

- "Guida alla Programmazione con Python - Corso completo per Imparare a Programmare in poco tempo" by Giuseppe Ciaburro, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2015 (In Italian)
- "Python (Pocket)" by Marco Beri, Apogeo, 2010 (In Italian)
- "Python for Informatics: Exploring Information", by Charles Russell Severance, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2013 (In English)

All Python scripts in this repository are tested with the Python 3 under the Ubuntu Linux 16.0.4 (LTS) and the MacOsX 11.* El-Capitan.
